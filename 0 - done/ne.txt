In order to use a file, you first need to ask for it by name. This is called opening the file. The open system call creates an operating system object called an open file. The open file is logically connected to the file you named in the open system call. An open file has a file location (or file descriptor) associated with it and that is the offset in the file where the next read or write will start. The way in which the file is opened is specified by the flags argument: O_RDONLY to read; O_WRONLY to write; O_RDWR to both read and write; you can also do a bitwise OR with O_CREAT if you want the system to create the file if it doesn’t exist already (e.g., O_RDONLY|O_CREAT creates and open in read mode). The system call returns the file descriptor of the new file (or a negative number if there is an error, placing the code into errno).
• After you open a file, you can use the read or write system calls to read or write the
